# News2, a refactored version of NewsWindow

This project is a return visit to Newswindow (https://github.com/mfhan/newswindow), a project I started while studying at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (July-Oct 2019). It uses the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) template.



## LINKS for initial app project:

-- Repo: https://github.com/mfhan/newswindow

-- Deployment: http://newsindow.surge.sh 

-- Medium post: https://medium.com/p/53f4e3debfa7/



## API info:
-- I used NewsApi.org, which has the properties (language, country) that I was looking for. Also tried : GNews, contextualwebsearch


## Basic functionality (app-as-an-exercise setup):

-- Allow user to input a search term
-- Allow user to push a BUTTON

## Future functionality (Heaven help me):
-- Render the API data in three separate containers 
-- For the non-English results, there is an automatic call to a translation API. 
-- Each news item is styled with a small logo 
-- The three news containers are styled so that their background color automatically fades when they are filled with news items.
